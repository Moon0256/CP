## Competitive Programming Practice

Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository! 
This repo contains my solutions to Codeforces problems.

*The contest folders have been named accurately and accordingly as those solved during the said contests, for exmaple: **[CodeforcesRound959Div1+2](/CodeforcesContests/CodeforcesRound959Div1+2/)** inside the **[CodeforcesContests](/CodeforcesContests/)**, while the problems solved out of contests will be included in other folders, for example: **[PracC++](/PracC++/)**, **[PracJava](/PracJava/)**, **[RandomCF](/RandomCF)**.*

## Languages

All of my solutions are written in either of the following:
- *C++*
- *Java*

P.S. I started my Competitive Programming journey with Java and transitioned to C++ (est. 29 June 2024) along the way.
